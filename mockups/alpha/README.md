A development environment has been created for writing a PHP app.

Edit files locally on your machine, the file changes will be synced
to the development environment automatically.

To run and view your application, run 'otto dev ssh' to enter the
development environment. You'll be placed directly into the working
directory where you can run "composer", "php", etc.

You can access the environment from this machine using the IP address above.
For example, if you start your app with 'php -S 0.0.0.0:5000', then you can
access it using the above IP at port 5000.
